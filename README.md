# NetherBot
 Repo for NetherBot, a discord bot written for Nether Vortex, a WoW guild on Draenor-EU.

 This is a hobby project done by Telkota.
 It's done so I can get some more experience in coding, and have something to show off.
 There probably will be bugs to iron out, and code might be messy and/or confusing.
 I'm not really a confident coder yet and still learning along the way.

 Report any bug to Telkota @ Discord or in the Nether Vortex discord server.

 Ver 0.1 - 07/nov/24 :
 - Made sure the bot can connect to discord.
